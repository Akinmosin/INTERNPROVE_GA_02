# GPT-2 Fine-Tuning and Text Generation

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a GPT-2 model using the Hugging Face `transformers` library for generative AI tasks. The model is trained on custom data to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on prompts.

## Project Overview

- **Model Used**: GPT-2
- **Libraries**: `transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`
- **Task**: Fine-tune GPT-2 on a custom dataset and use it for text generation.

## Task Description

As part of my internship at Intern Prove, I completed the following task:
- **Task**: Fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate coherent text based on prompts.
- **Objective**: Create a model that mimics the style and structure of the provided dataset and generates relevant text responses.
- **Approach**:
  1. Collected and prepared a custom dataset.
  2. Fine-tuned the GPT-2 model using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
  3. Implemented text generation using the fine-tuned model.

## Instructions for Running the Project

### Requirements

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `datasets`

## To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Fine-Tuning the Model
To fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the custom dataset, run the following command:

python scripts/fine_tune_gpt2.py
The script will load the dataset, fine-tune GPT-2, and save the model in the models/ directory.

Generating Text
After fine-tuning, you can generate text using the fine-tuned model. Use the following command:

python scripts/generate_text.py
This script will load the model and generate text based on a prompt provided in the script. You can modify the prompt or change the generation parameters as needed.

### Step 2: Commit and Push the Changes

1. **Stage the `README.md` File**:
   - In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and stage the updated `README.md` file:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     ```

2. **Commit the Changes**:
   - Commit the changes with a message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Updated README with project details"
     ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push the changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

### Step 3: Verify on GitHub

1. **Go to Your Repository**:
   ## Open GitHub in your browser, go to your repository, and check if the `README.md` has been updated with the new information.
